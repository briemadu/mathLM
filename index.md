without notice. After that, any modification will be discussed/announced
in the Moodle forum.

## Description
Language models are a component of several natural language processing systems
and applications such as machine translation and automatic speech recognition.
They have been in the spotlight recently with the advent of gigantic,
pre-trained models being released in the industry (e.g. BERT and GPT3).
In this course, you will become familiar with the development of language models
and with the mathematical foundations that are needed to understand, evaluate,
implement and improve them, as well as to critically assess their usage and
limitations.

## Goals
- know the uses and limitations of language models
- comprehend the mathematical concepts behind language models
- be able to implement, review and improve Python code for training and evaluating language models
- be acquainted with the currently common language model architectures
- understand the ethical implications of widespread use of language models

## Format

TBD.

The course will be taught in English, but you can present and submit your
assignments and the project in German if you prefer.

**Please, check the guidelines and the schedule for more details.**
Note that this page is meant only to present the course, but we'll use Moodle
for everything else (submissions, announcements, question forums etc),
so **please enrol in the Moodle course page**.

## Background
Everyone is welcome to take this class. Good knowledge of Python is required
for the assignments. If you are in doubt, contact me :)

## Requirements and grading policy

To pass the course:
- active participation (taking part on group discussions and handing in worksheets)

To pass the module:
- final project

To pass the course/module, you must achieve a performance of at least 60%,
which includes abiding by the guidelines
listed [here](https://briemadu.github.io/mathLM/guidelines).

## Contact
Feel free to contact me if you have any question or suggestion.
Please let me know if you have any needs
(e.g. accessibility or name preference) or if you are facing any issue that
demands adjustments (e.g. caring for family members or health).

Iâ€™m always willing to help if you start facing extra difficulties
with the content as well.  

I hope to see you soon! :wink:
