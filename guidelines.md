# Guidelines

Here are the detailed guidelines for this seminar. Please read them carefully.

On our first meeting on Oct 27, I will introduce and motivate the topic in a
live session and we'll get to know each other. Then we'll alternate among
three types of lessons:

- crash courses: to learn the mathematical foundations
- content: to apply the mathematical content to language modelling
- practical sessions: to work on Python code covering the recent content

This course will mostly follow an inverted classroom scheme.

Each Wednesday at 14:00 I will publish a reading/watching list on Moodle.
You need to work through that on your own during the week. Feel free to organise
reading groups with your friends to do that together.
There will be a documentation form on Moodle about the week's content that you
must fill in until the following Wednesday at 10:00.

We'll meet at Wednesdays at 12:00. In our meetings, you will work in
randomly assigned groups
to solve an exercise sheet or a short programming assignment. I will also use
part of the time to give feedback about the previous week and help you with
your questions.

You must upload your solutions on Moodle by the following Monday at 23:59.

**Come to class prepared**, i.e., watch the videos / read the
material **before** our meeting.

This course is a reading/discussion-based seminar, which means that it
requires a 'minds on' and proactive approach from participants. Plan your schedule
accordingly, as some weeks will require a lot of reading.

***The weekly documentation, worksheets and programming assignments are
requirements to pass the course.***

# Integrity

* Any material you hand in must be your own. I will not grade work that contains plagiarism. If you are using external sources, [cite them properly](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/citingsources). Still, do not copy text, use them only to support your arguments.
* Help creating a nice environment for everyone: be polite, respect different opinions and help each other. Any kind of harassment is forbidden - contact me if you face any problem.
* The material in Moodle is private and only accessible to participants of the course, so that every participant feels safe to expose their thoughts. Due to data protection, you are not allowed to share anything from Moodle anywhere.
